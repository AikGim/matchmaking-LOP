    "### **Methodology**\n",
    "Here is a detailed mention of how we plan to match individuals using each of the considered factors shown above.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Gender** and **Gender Preference**\n",
    "For gender, participants are free to choose ONE of the 3 gender options that represents them: ['Male', 'Female', 'Others']. This is represented as a binary array, that is, the option 'Male' is equivalent to [1,0,0] in our model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each participant are also required to declare their preferred gender(s) in their partner. This option allows participants to select more than 1 gender for their ideal partner.\n",
    "\n",
    "When matching, the model is required to pair individuals in a manner that respects both of their gender preferences. This is a constraint in the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Age** and **Maximum Age Gap**\n",
    "For age, participants are required to declare their age as an integer whole number.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each participant are then required to specify the maximum age gap between them and their ideal partner.\n",
    "\n",
    "During matching, the model is only allowed to pair individuals who satisfy one another's age requirement. This is a constraint in the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Availability** and **Duration of meetup**\n",
    "For availability, participants fit their calendar schedules for the week (they could do so months or a year in advanced but we will only look at the current week for our matching problem). This data will be represented as a binary 2d matrix where each row correspond to each day of the week (Mon-Sun) and each column represent a specific 1-hour time slot. We consider 1-hour timeslots from 8 am to 10 pm each day as that is assumed to be when most of our attractions are open and the \"normal\" dating hours.\n",
    "\n",
    "For e.g. for Monday, Joe's availability might be [1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]. Which means he is only available for 8 am - 9 am and 9pm to 10 pm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each participant are required to state their minimum & maximum preferred dating duration.\n",
    "For e.g. minimum 3 hours, maximum 6 hours.\n",
    "\n",
    "During matching, the model will only consider pairs where both parties calendar align such that the minimum dating duration of both parties are satisfied. When planning for activities, the planning model will consider the lower of the two parties' maximum preferred dating duration to satisfy and maximise everyone's time.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Interest** and **Preference for similarity**\n",
    "For interest, participants are given an array of 8 types of activities genre - namely: Adventure, Wellness, Sightseeing, Animals & Nature, Art & Culture, Food & Culinary, Fitness, and Recreational activities.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Disclaimer: This list of genres are NOT exhaustive but they will suffice for our POC model.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Participants are required to rank each activity genre on a scale from 1 - 5. The intention is to create an Interest Vector array that encapsulates the \"interests\" of a particular individual. This particular interest array is also reused in PART 2 for date planning.\n",
    "\n",
    "On top of having an array of interest ranked, each participant will also specify their similarity preference in their partners, this preference value falls on a scale from 0% (Completely different from me) to 100% (Exactly like me).\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea of have a 'preference for similarity' is to respect the idea that some people seek out people like themselves while others look for those who are more different than them.\n",
    "\n",
    "To match two people based on interest, the model will consider how closely their interests align. Additionally, it will also account for the similarity/dissimilarity preferences for both parties.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Traits**\n",
    "For traits, participants are required to select a certain number of traits (that they feel represents them) from a list of 30 or so traits. The traits are namely: *Ambitious, Authentic, Caring, Cheerful, Committed, Confident, Creative, Easy-going, Energetic, Funny, Generous, Honest, Humble, Independent, Intelligent, Kind, Loyal, Mature, Open-minded, Optimistic, Outgoing, Patient, Practical, Respectful, Responsible, Romantic, Social, Supportive, Thoughtful, Trustworthy.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*Disclaimer: This list of traits are NOT exhaustive but they will suffice for our POC model.*\n",
    "\n",
    "The traits will be captured in the form of a binary vector array where 1 represents possessing a trait while 0 represents otherwise. For e.g. [1,0,1] could mean: \"loyal\", not \"patient\", \"caring\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that participants can only choose up to a certain number of traits so as to prevent them from being \"perfect\" individuals, they must prioritise choosing traits that they believe truly represent themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each participant are also then required to select the same number of traits for their ideal partner (out of the same trait list).\n",
    "\n",
    "The model will attempt to match two people by how closely their traits satisfy their partner's preferred traits and vice-versa. The idea is to perform some kind of similarity measure on the traits vector array as mentioned above.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Seriousness**\n",
    "\n",
    "For \"seriousness\", we consider the participants' \"intention\" or \"goal\" for joining our matchmaking service.\n",
    "\n",
    "We identified that different people may be at different stages of their lives - some are looking to date to meet new people while others are looking to settle down with a long-term partner.\n",
    "\n",
    "Participants are required to rank their \"seriousness\" by using a value that falls on a scale where 0% (I am strictly looking for friendship, I am not interested in a relationship at the moment) to 100% (I would like to settle down with a long-term partner).\n",
    "\n",
    "To match two people on account of \"seriousness\", we will compare how different their answers are to this metric. The model will attempt to match people who are closer in \"seriousness\" since their goals for meeting one another align better.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Value ranking**\n",
    "\n",
    "For \"value ranking\", we simply get the participants to provide weights to each of the following factors mentioned above:\n",
    "(1) Interest + similarity\n",
    "(2) Traits\n",
    "(3) Seriousness\n",
    "\n",
    "Participants are give 10 points, they must allocate the 10 points as \"weights\" across each of the 3 compatibility measure and use up all the points. Each point has a weight of 0.1 and the more weight a factor is given, the more influence it has over the final compatibility score.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example: if John allocates 3 points to Interest, 6 points to Traits and 1 points to Seriousness. The resulting compatibility score between him and his ideal partner (for him) would look like:\n",
    "\n",
    "0.3 * interest compatibility + 0.6 * traits compatibility + 0.1 * seriousness compatibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note that since interest, traits and serious compatibility are all metrics with continuous scale (0-1) -> the resulting value from applying the weights as described above would also be 0-1*\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is to give individuals the freedom to determine how much they value each particular factor in finding a partner.\n",
    " \n",
    "##### **Compatibility Score computation**\n",
    "Last and probably most importantly, we derive the compatibility score using all of the above mentioned metrics. This score represents how compatible two individuals are and it falls on a scale from 0% (not compatible) to 100% (perfectly compatible).\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that compatiblility is NOT bi-directional in our interpretation, that is, person j's compatibility to person i need not be the same as person i's compatibility to person j. We have chosen this interpretation because in real life, we cannot expect other people to like us just as much as we like them (sometimes its more, sometimes less).\n",
    "\n",
    "Nevertheless, we still assume a conservative estimate to finalize a pair's TRUE compatibility by considering the **minimum** of the two's compatibility score.\n",
    "\n",
    "That is, if Z_ij represents a pair's true compatibility score, then Z_ij = min(C_ij, C_ji)."

    "### **Part 1.2 Populating the data**\n",
    "To test the robustness of our model, we need to populate the data randomly. We can randomize the characteristics of our love-seeking participants. Some randomization follow appropriate probability distribution functions to reflect some degree of realism (but this will not perfectly represent the real-world as many assumptions were made).\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, we populated (randomly) the data such that there will be more people who identify as *male* and *female* than *others* (assumption: a small minority of people identify as 'others').\n",
    "\n",
    "We also made it so that *males* are more likely to prefer *females* (with a small probability of deviation) and vice-versa but *others* are more uniform in their preference and hence more liberal about their preferred partner's gender.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also assumed that most people preferred partners that are more similar to them (backed up by research: https://www.insider.com/opposites-do-not-attract-in-relationships-2018-2#:~:text=The%20idea%20that%20%22opposites%20attract,and%20become%20bigger%20over%20time.)\n",
    "\n",
    "*As such, we made it more probable for people to prefer a **similarity** score > 50% (when randomly populating preference for similarity).\n",
    "\n",
    "For **availability**, we assumed that people were more free on weekends and are more free during LUNCH and AFTERWORK hours for weekdays. The distribution is populated as such.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Note: Here, we are also populating data for the date-planning model in PART TWO, so let's get some of the assumptions out of the way***\n",
    "\n",
    "For **budget**, we allowed participants to hold a value from 0 to 100 dollars but we conservatively assume that most people are only okay with spending 20 - 50 dollars on a single date, so those numbers are more common.\n",
    "\n",
    "For **distance**, we conservatively take a uniform range from 0 to 20 KM. This is to simulate people's appetite on travel based on the mode of transport they have access to. For example, if someone has a car, he/she would be more willing to travel further than someone who doesn't. Regardless, we will still take the lesser of the two distance preference when planning a date for two people.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Data points that are not mentioned will follow a uniform distribution where there is equal probability in landing at each possible data point. This is fair as in reality, people are vastly different in these fields (e.g. interests) and this assumption does not harm our study.***"

    "\n",
    "In this next step, we must define exactly how we plan to compute compatibility based on our described methodologies above.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, given a large group of people, how do we ensure that everyone (hopefully) gets a compatible match? Understandably, not everyone may get a match due to limiting constraints like age, gender, availability and compatibility - but the idea here is to maximise everyone's resulting compatibility with their assigned partner while satisfying (as much as possible) everyone's preferences. In computer science, this is known as the matching problem and we are attempting to solve a special variation of it."

    "\n",
    "The first step is to consider the conditions that allow the model to pair two people up.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our conditions are:\n",
    "1. Both partners must satisfy their partners' gender requirement\n",
    "2. Both partners must satisfy their partners' age requirement\n",
    "3. Both partners must have at least 1 common availability time period that exceeds both parties' desired minimal date duration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's spend some time examining (3) as it is the most complex out of all the matching requirement.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Matching by Availability**\n",
    "\n",
    "To match people's availability, we look at the *Longest Common Contiguous Availability* for both party, let's call this property LCCA.\n",
    "\n",
    "LCCA, as the name suggest, is the longest time range that two people are available for without any gaps or break. We have established that **Availability is a 2D binary matrix** with the rows being the 7 days of the week and the columns being 1-hour timeslots between the period of 8 AM to 10 PM. In this case, an element being 1 means that the person is available for that time slot on that day.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's take monday's schedule for:\n",
    "* person i to be [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,**1,1,1,1,1**]\n",
    "* person j to be [1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,**1,1,1,1,1**].\n",
    "\n",
    "Then the LCCA for Monday for both of them would be the last 5 timeslices resulting in a LCCA OF 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "**To find the (week's) overall LCCA:** we simply need to find the LCCA for each day between two peoples, and take the largest one to be our LCCA.\n",
    "\n",
    "As such, the week's overall LCA would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "{LCCA}_{ij} = {\\max}({LCCA}_{ij1}, {LCCA}_{ij2}, ... , {LCCA}_{ij7})\n",

    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\forall i,j\\in\\{1,2,...n\\}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $d$ in ${LCCA}_{ijd}$ represents the day of the week, $i$ and $j$ represents the id of two different person.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is to suggest the date during the highest LCCA for the week for person $i$ and $j$ as it is the longest contiguous block of time where both parties can spend quality time with each other. Of course, in reality, pairs can always choose to compare schedules and choose other available timeblocks if so desired.\n",

    "**Matching Quality**\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also study how the matching quality changes with increasing problem size N. To do this, We find the *average objective value (total objective value divided by N)* tather than absolute value for each size N since it's natural for objective value of higher sample sizes to be higher (more matches).\n",
    "\n",
    "Careful observation tells us that the average quality of matches is relatively stable when N is increasing, this could be due to the model's strategic balancing between satisfying everyone's preference and making as many matches as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Choosing problem size N**\n",
    "\n",
    "We now know that increase to the pool of participants will be advantageous as the model not only perform more matches, the quality of said matches do not suffer. As such, a real implementation should try to use some large N that is reasonably computable.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Improving the model**\n",
    "\n",
    "One should take note that the study performed above is executed on randomly populated data (we undertook such an assumption to simulate worse case and realism) and this leaves a lot of room for improvement.\n",

    "The model can become more optimized if the group of people to be matched are grouped strategically. For example, this could mean grouping people together with the similar age, interest, schedule, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the model on strategically grouped participants will yield better matching results due to some of the constraints being relaxed by the nature of the grouping. In such cases, one would observe better matching quality and volume."
